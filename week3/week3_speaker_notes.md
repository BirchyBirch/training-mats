## Opening (5 minutes)

### Welcome & Recap
**"Welcome back everyone! Let's quickly recap what we covered in Week 2..."**

**Key Points to Mention:**
- Week 2 covered combinators (descendant, child, sibling) and the box model
- Today we're moving into more advanced territory with modern CSS approaches
- These techniques will make your CSS more maintainable and internationally-friendly

**Transition:** *"Today we're focusing on three areas that will significantly improve your CSS: logical properties for modern layouts, pseudo-elements for cleaner HTML, and pseudo-classes for better interactivity."*

## Section 1: Logical vs Physical Properties (20 minutes)

### Opening Hook (2 minutes)
**"How many of you have ever worked on a website that needed to support right-to-left languages like Arabic or Hebrew?"**

**Demonstrate the Problem:**
- Show traditional CSS with margin-left, padding-left
- Explain how this breaks in RTL languages
- *"This is exactly why logical properties exist."*

### Theory Explanation (8 minutes)

#### Physical vs Logical Concept
**"Think of it this way:"**
- **Physical properties** = "Put this margin on the LEFT side" (always left, regardless of language)
- **Logical properties** = "Put this margin on the START side" (adapts to language direction)

**Key Teaching Points:**
1. **Block direction** = Usually top/bottom (vertical flow)
2. **Inline direction** = Usually left/right (horizontal flow, but flips in RTL)
3. **Start/End** = Beginning/end of reading direction
4. **Before/After** = Earlier/later in document flow

#### Property Mappings (Use the demo page)
```css
/* Show this progression */
margin-left: 20px;           /* Physical - always left */
margin-inline-start: 20px;   /* Logical - left in LTR, right in RTL */
```

**Emphasize:** *"The beauty is that you write it once, and it automatically adapts."*

### Live Demo (8 minutes)

#### Demo Script:
1. **Open the demo page to the logical properties section**
   - Point out the red vs green borders on the comparison boxes
   - *"Notice how both boxes look the same right now"*

2. **Click the direction toggle button**
   - *"Watch what happens to the logical properties box when I switch to RTL"*
   - Point out how the border and padding flip sides
   - *"The physical properties box stays exactly the same - that's the problem!"*

3. **Show in DevTools:**
   - Inspect the `.direction-test` element
   - Show how `margin-inline-start` appears in the computed styles
   - *"The browser is automatically calculating which physical direction this should be"*

#### Common Questions to Address:
- **"Do I need to rewrite all my CSS?"** - No, use it for new components and gradually adopt
- **"What's browser support like?"** - Very good in modern browsers, show feature queries
- **"When should I use this?"** - International sites, future-proofing, new projects

### Practical Application (2 minutes)
**"In your daily work, start with these properties:"**
- `margin-inline` instead of left/right margins
- `padding-inline` for horizontal padding
- `border-inline-start` for accent borders
- `text-align: start` instead of `text-align: left`

## Section 2: Pseudo-elements Deep Dive (15 minutes)

### Opening Hook (2 minutes)
**"How many times have you added a `<span>` or `<div>` just to add a decorative star or quotation mark?"**

**Show the problem:**
```html
<!-- Instead of this... -->
<div class="card">
    <span class="icon">★</span>
    <h3>Featured Item</h3>
</div>
```

**"What if I told you CSS can create those elements for you?"**

### Theory & Examples (8 minutes)

#### ::before and ::after Essentials
**"The two most important rules about ::before and ::after:"**
1. **Always need `content` property** - even if it's empty: `content: "";`
2. **Often need `display` property** - usually `block` or `inline-block`

**Live Demo Script:**
1. **Show the quote example on demo page**
   - *"See these quotation marks? No HTML was needed."*
   - Inspect in DevTools to show the pseudo-elements
   - *"Notice they appear as separate elements in the DOM"*

2. **Show featured items with stars**
   - *"Every featured item gets a star automatically"*
   - Right-click and inspect to show the `::before` pseudo-element

3. **Show NEW badges**
   - *"These badges are positioned absolutely using ::after"*
   - Point out how the positioning works

#### Other Pseudo-elements (3 minutes)
**::first-letter Demo:**
- Scroll to the drop cap example
- *"This creates magazine-style drop caps without any extra markup"*
- Show how `float: left` makes the text wrap around

**::first-line Demo:**
- Point out the uppercase, bold first line
- *"This automatically styles just the first line, regardless of screen size"*

**::placeholder Demo:**
- Click in the form inputs
- *"Custom placeholder styling for better UX"*

### Common Use Cases (2 minutes)
**"Here's when to reach for pseudo-elements:"**
- **Icons and symbols** - Stars, arrows, checkmarks
- **Decorative elements** - Borders, shapes, overlays
- **Content additions** - "NEW" badges, quotation marks
- **Typography effects** - Drop caps, emphasis

**Pro tip:** *"If you're adding HTML just for styling, consider a pseudo-element instead."*

## Section 3: Pseudo-classes Mastery (15 minutes)

### Interactive States (5 minutes)

#### Button Demo
**"Let's start with the most common pseudo-classes - interactive states."**

**Demo Script:**
1. **Hover over the demo buttons**
   - *"Notice the smooth hover effect with transform and shadow"*
   - *"This gives immediate visual feedback"*

2. **Tab through the buttons**
   - *"The focus state is crucial for accessibility"*
   - *"Never remove focus outlines without replacing them"*

3. **Click and hold a button**
   - *"The active state provides tactile feedback"*

**Key Teaching Point:** *"Always think: hover → focus → active. In that order."*

#### Form States (4 minutes)

**Demo Script:**
1. **Focus on the email input**
   - *"See the blue border and subtle shadow? That's :focus"*
   
2. **Type an invalid email**
   - *"As soon as it's invalid, the border turns red"*
   - *"This is :invalid working in real-time"*

3. **Complete a valid email**
   - *"Green border shows :valid state"*

4. **Point out the red asterisks**
   - *"These come from the :required pseudo-class"*

**Emphasize:** *"This creates a much better user experience than waiting for form submission."*

### Structural Pseudo-classes (6 minutes)

#### List Demo
**"Now for the really powerful stuff - structural selectors."**

**Demo Script:**
1. **Point out the list styling**
   - *"First item has blue background - that's :first-child"*
   - *"Last item has yellow background - that's :last-child"*
   - *"Every other item is gray - that's :nth-child(even)"*
   - *"Items 3 and 6 are blue and bold - that's :nth-child(3n)"*

2. **Explain the nth-child pattern**
   - *"3n means every 3rd item: 3, 6, 9, 12..."*
   - *"3n+1 would be: 1, 4, 7, 10..."*
   - *"3n+2 would be: 2, 5, 8, 11..."*

#### Table Demo
**"Here's a practical example - zebra striping."**

1. **Hover over table rows**
   - *"Hover effect for better UX"*
   
2. **Point out the price column**
   - *"Third column is always highlighted - :nth-child(3)"*
   
3. **Point out alternating row colors**
   - *"Even rows are gray - much easier than adding classes to every row"*

**Pro tip:** *"This is incredibly useful for data tables and card grids."*

## Hands-on Practice (10 minutes)

### Exercise Introduction (1 minute)
**"Now let's practice with some real scenarios you'll encounter."**

**Set expectations:**
- Work in pairs if possible
- Don't worry about getting it perfect
- Focus on understanding the concepts

### Exercise 1: Property Conversion (3 minutes)
**"First exercise - convert physical to logical properties."**

**Show the example code:**
```css
.sidebar {
    margin-top: 20px;
    margin-right: 0;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    margin-left: 16px;
    padding-left: 24px;
    border-left: 2px solid #ddd;
    width: 300px;
}
```

**Guide them through:**
- *"Start with the margins - what would replace top/bottom?"*
- *"What about left/right margins that are different?"*
- *"How would you handle the border-left?"*

**Solution walkthrough:**
```css
.sidebar {
    margin-block: 20px;              /* top and bottom */
    margin-inline-end: 0;            /* right */
    margin-inline-start: 16px;       /* left */
    padding-inline-start: 24px;      /* left */
    border-inline-start: 2px solid #ddd;  /* left */
    inline-size: 300px;              /* width */
}
```

### Exercise 2: Pseudo-element Challenge (3 minutes)
**"Now let's add some visual elements without touching the HTML."**

**Challenge tasks:**
1. Add a star before .featured items
2. Add a "NEW" badge after .new-item elements  
3. Add custom quotes around .testimonial text

**Give hints:**
- *"Remember: content property is required"*
- *"For positioning badges, you might need position: absolute"*
- *"For quotes, think about ::before and ::after"*

### Exercise 3: Advanced Selectors (3 minutes)
**"Finally, let's practice some nth-child patterns."**

**Challenges:**
1. Every 3rd product starting from the 2nd: `:nth-child(3n+2)`
2. Invalid required inputs: `input:required:invalid`
3. First paragraph not in .intro: `p:not(.intro p):first-of-type`

**Debrief:** Walk through each solution and explain the logic.
