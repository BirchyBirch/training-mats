## Opening (5 minutes) [0:00-0:05]

**Share screen: Demo page at top**

### Opening Script:
*"Good morning! Last week we covered CSS fundamentals - selectors, specificity, and units. Today we're building on that foundation with advanced selectors called combinators, then diving into the box model for consistent spacing."*

**Quick Recap Questions:**
- *"Who can tell me what wins: a class selector or an element selector?"* (Class - 10 vs 1 specificity)
- *"When should you use rem vs px?"* (rem for consistency, px for precision)

**Today's Focus:**
- Combinators - targeting elements based on relationships
- Box model - understanding spacing and sizing
- Angular component patterns and best practices

**Transition:** *"Let's start by building on the selectors we learned last week..."*

## Section 1: CSS Combinators (15 minutes) [0:05-0:20]

**Navigate to: Section 1 on demo page**

### Main Teaching Points:

#### Foundation Building (3 minutes)
*"Last week we learned basic selectors - element, class, and ID. Combinators let us target elements based on their relationships to other elements."*

**Show the four combinator examples:**
1. **Descendant (space):** "Targets any nested element, no matter how deep"
2. **Child (>):** "Only direct children, not grandchildren"  
3. **Adjacent sibling (+):** "The very next sibling element"
4. **General sibling (~):** "Any following sibling at the same level"

#### Live Examples Walkthrough (5 minutes)
**Point to the demo examples:**
- *"See the card with the header? That header is a direct child of .card"*
- *"The paragraph inside .content is a descendant of .card but not a direct child"*
- *"Notice how the first paragraph after the h2 looks different? That's the adjacent sibling selector"*

#### Angular Context (4 minutes)
*"In Angular components, these are incredibly useful:"*

**Show the Angular code examples:**
- `:host > button` - *"Style only buttons that are direct children of your component"*
- `:host mat-form-field + mat-form-field` - *"Add spacing between consecutive Material form fields"*
- *"ViewEncapsulation.Emulated means these selectors won't affect other components"*

#### Specificity Connection (3 minutes)
*"Remember specificity from last week? Combinators don't add to specificity themselves, but each selector in the combination does."*

**Quick calculation exercise:**
- `.card .header` = ? (0,0,2,0 - two classes)
- `h2 + p` = ? (0,0,0,2 - two elements)

**Interactive Moment:**
*"Everyone inspect the card header and look at the Styles panel. You'll see multiple rules targeting it."*

**Transition:** *"Now that we can target elements precisely, let's understand how they're sized and spaced..."*

## Section 2: Box Model Fundamentals (15 minutes) [0:20-0:35]

**Navigate to: Section 1 on demo page**

### Main Teaching Points:

#### Visual Demonstration (5 minutes)
1. **Point to the three colored boxes**
   - "Each box has the same content width - 200px"
   - "But they're all different total sizes. Why?"
   - "This is the box model in action"

2. **Break down the calculation**
   - Point to Box 1: "200px + 32px padding + 16px border = 248px total"
   - Emphasize: "The width property only sets the content area"

#### Interactive Moment (5 minutes)
*"Everyone right-click on the blue box and inspect it..."*
- Guide them to the Computed tab
- Show the box model diagram
- *"See the blue center? That's your 200px content. The green is padding, yellow is border."*

#### Angular Connection (3 minutes)
*"In your Angular components, every element follows these same rules:"*
- Component root (`:host`) is a box
- Child elements are boxes
- ViewEncapsulation doesn't change box model behavior

#### Key Concept Reinforcement (2 minutes)
*"The most important thing: when you set width: 200px, you're only setting the content width. Padding and border get added on top."*

**Common Student Question:**
- Q: "So if I want a 200px total width, what do I set the width to?"
- A: "That depends on your padding and border - or we can use a better approach..."

**Transition:** *"There's a CSS property that changes this entire calculation..."*

---

## Section 2: Box-Sizing Deep Dive (15 minutes) [0:20-0:35]

**Navigate to: Section 2 on demo page**

### Box-Sizing Comparison (8 minutes)

#### Visual Demonstration
1. **Point to the two boxes side by side**
   - "Same CSS except for one property - box-sizing"
   - "Left box: content-box (default) = 260px total"
   - "Right box: border-box = 200px total"

2. **Explain the difference**
   - content-box: "Width applies to content only"
   - border-box: "Width includes content, padding, and border"

#### Live Calculation
*"Let's do the math together:"*
- content-box: 200px + 40px padding + 20px border = 260px
- border-box: 200px total (padding and border come out of that 200px)

### Angular Best Practice (4 minutes)

**Show the Angular code example:**
```css
*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

*"Most professional Angular applications use border-box globally. It integrates better with Angular Material and makes responsive design calculations much simpler."*

**Component-level approach:**
```css
:host {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

*"This approach is component-scoped due to ViewEncapsulation.Emulated. It won't affect other components."*

### Why Border-Box Matters (3 minutes)

**Responsive Design Example:**
*"This is especially important in Angular applications with responsive components:"*
- content-box: Flex items with padding can overflow their containers
- border-box: Flex items fit perfectly within their allocated space
- Angular Material components rely on this behavior for consistent layouts

**Integration Question:**
*"How many of you use Angular Material components alongside custom components?"*
- Get responses
- *"Material assumes border-box sizing. If your custom components use content-box, you'll get inconsistent spacing and alignment."*

**Transition:** *"Let's see this in action with our interactive demo..."*

## Section 3: Interactive Demo & DevTools (15 minutes) [0:35-0:50]

**Navigate to: Section 3 on demo page**

### Interactive Manipulation (8 minutes)

#### Hands-On Activity
*"Everyone follow along with me. We're going to change this box and watch what happens:"*

1. **Start with default settings**
   - "Notice the calculation: 250px total"
   - "Now I'll increase the padding..." (drag slider)
   - "Watch the total width increase"

2. **Toggle border-box**
   - "Now I'll check the border-box toggle..."
   - "Same settings, but now total width stays at 200px"
   - "The padding comes out of the content area instead"

3. **Have them experiment**
   - "Try changing the sliders yourself"
   - "Right-click and inspect the demo box"
   - "Watch the DevTools box model diagram update"

### DevTools Mastery (7 minutes)

#### Guided DevTools Exploration
*"Let's become DevTools experts. Everyone inspect the demo box:"*

1. **Elements Panel Navigation**
   - "Find the demo box in the HTML"
   - "Look at the Styles panel - see our CSS rules"

2. **Computed Tab Deep Dive**
   - "Click the Computed tab"
   - "Scroll down to find the box model diagram"
   - "This is your debugging best friend"

3. **Interactive Editing**
   - "In the Styles panel, click on a padding value"
   - "Change it and press Enter"
   - "Watch both the element and box model update"

#### Debugging Workflow Demo
*"Here's the systematic approach when something looks wrong:"*
1. Inspect the element
2. Check the box model diagram
3. Verify box-sizing property
4. Calculate expected vs actual
5. Test fixes in DevTools
6. Apply to your code

**Transition:** *"Now let's look at real problems from Angular apps..."*

## Section 4: Angular Problems & Solutions (15 minutes) [0:50-1:05]

**Navigate to: Section 4 on demo page**

### Common Problems Walkthrough (10 minutes)

#### Problem 1: Inconsistent Spacing (3 minutes)
**Show the bad example:**
- "Look at this card component - the spacing looks random"
- "8px, 12px, 6px, 15px - this creates visual chaos"

**Show the good example:**
- "Same component with consistent spacing"
- "Uses 1rem (16px) consistently"
- "Looks professional and intentional"

**Angular Connection:**
*"In your Angular components, define spacing variables:"*
```css
:host {
  --spacing-sm: 0.5rem;
  --spacing-md: 1rem;
}
```

#### Problem 2: Unexpected Sizes (4 minutes)
**Navigate to Section 5 broken layout**
- "These boxes should be 100px wide, but they're much bigger"
- "Classic content-box problem"

**Interactive Debugging:**
*"Let's debug this together:"*
1. Inspect a broken box
2. Check the box model diagram
3. Calculate: 100px + 20px padding + 10px border = 130px
4. Solution: Add box-sizing: border-box

#### Problem 3: Spacing Scale (3 minutes)
**Show the spacing scale examples:**
- "This is what consistent spacing looks like"
- "4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px progression"
- "Use these values consistently across your app"

**Angular Implementation:**
*"Define these as CSS custom properties in your component or globally."*

### Real-World Application (5 minutes)

#### Show Angular Component Example
*"Here's how this looks in a real Angular component:"*

**Point to the final code example:**
- `:host` styling with border-box
- Consistent spacing variables
- Flex layout with gap property

**Interactive Question:**
*"Who has components where buttons or cards don't align properly?"*
- Get responses
- *"That's usually a box model issue - inconsistent sizing or spacing"*

**Live Problem Solving:**
If possible, show a screenshot from your actual app:
- "Here's a spacing issue from our app"
- "Let's identify: is this margin, padding, or sizing?"
- "What DevTools steps would we take?"

## Section 5: Advanced Concepts (Optional - if time) [1:05-1:10]

**Navigate to: Section 6 if time permits**

### Margin Collapsing (3 minutes)
*"One more concept that trips people up - margin collapsing:"*
- "Two elements with margins don't add up like you'd expect"
- "20px + 30px margins = 30px gap, not 50px"
- "Flexbox prevents this, which is why gap property is useful"

### Box Model Edge Cases (2 minutes)
*"A few quick edge cases to be aware of:"*
- Inline elements: width/height don't apply
- Absolutely positioned elements: still follow box model
- Flexbox: box model applies but with flex-specific behavior

---

## Wrap-up (5 minutes) [1:05-1:10]

**Navigate to: Section 7 Key Takeaways**

### Summary Points:
- **border-box is your friend** - makes sizing predictable
- **Consistent spacing scale** - prevents visual chaos
- **DevTools box model diagram** - your debugging tool
- **Angular components** - set box-sizing on :host

### Assignment Preview:
*"This week, audit 3 components in your current project:"*
- Check their box-sizing property
- Look for inconsistent spacing
- Practice using DevTools to debug layout issues

### Next Week Preview:
*"Next week: Advanced DevTools techniques and systematic CSS debugging workflows."*

**Final Interactive Moment:**
*"Before we finish - everyone bookmark this demo page. Use the interactive sliders when you're confused about box model calculations."*

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If Interactive Demo Fails:
- Focus on static examples in sections 1 and 2
- Use browser zoom to make box model differences more visible
- Have students calculate totals manually

### If Students Seem Overwhelmed:
- Slow down on box-sizing concept
- Repeat the content-box vs border-box comparison
- Ask them to calculate totals out loud

### If Time Runs Short:
- Skip Section 6 (advanced concepts)
- Focus on border-box and DevTools
- Make assignment longer to cover skipped material

### Energy Boosters:
- *"Everyone change their padding slider and see what happens"*
- *"Who can calculate the total width of this box?"*
- *"Let's all inspect this element together"*
